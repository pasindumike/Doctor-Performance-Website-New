6. Version Control and Best Practices
This project follows Git-based version control to track all changes and manage collaboration efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Git Workflow for Updates
Clone the repository (if not already done)

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/pasindumike/Doctor-Performance-Website-New.git
Pull the latest updates before making changes

sh

Edit
git pull origin main
Make necessary changes and commit them

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Updated website content"

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin main

Best Practices for GitHub Usage
ðŸ”¹Tracking progress needs frequent commit practices when developers maintain small change deposits.
ðŸ”¹All changes need distinct descriptions in their commit messages.
ðŸ”¹Major updates require their own dedicated branches according to this strategy rather than direct modifications on main.

7. Industry Standards and Compliance
This project adheres to the most standard approaches in web development and version control practices found in the professional industry:

Web Development Standards
This project applies the cutting-edge standards of HTML5 and CSS3 for building web structure and design.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience on different screen sizes.

SEO Best Practices: Follows semantic HTML for better search engine rankings.

Git & Version Control Compliance
The project utilizes Git for an effective version tracking mechanism which acts as a Versioning System.

Remote Repository Management: Uses GitHub for cloud-based version control.

The system enables multiple users to collaborate because it supports pull request features and issue tracking mechanisms.

8. Strengths and Limitations
ðŸ”¹ Strengths
HTML and CSS only produce a platform which performs well and loads quickly because of its lightweight nature.
The system maintains easy maintenance without depending on backend structure and complex framework elements.
Free Hosting via GitHub Pages â€“ No additional costs for deployment.
The project allows anyone to enhance or make betterments because it operates as an open-source platform.

ðŸ”¹ Limitations
Basic features cannot be accessed since the platform lacks support for either JavaScript or backend development.
Changes to the website require users to commit Git changes followed by a push action to show them online.
Static Content â€“ No dynamic user interactions without JavaScript.

9. Conclusion
The Doctor Performance website functions as a clean fitness coaching platform with efficient features and responsive design built from HTML and CSS features. The platform adopts GitHub to provide version control and hosting which enables users to maintain and access the system easily.

This project implements industry-accepted standards which establish future development possibilities by enabling JavaScript applications or backend implementation. ðŸš€

âœ… Next Steps
The design needs animation features and transition effects that should be implemented.

Add JavaScript code to your project for dealing with interactive elements that include forms and pop-ups.

The optimization process for both metadata specifications and website loading times is essential for better SEO performance.
